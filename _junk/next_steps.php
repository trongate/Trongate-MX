Based on the HTMX trigger types, we can identify some groups that may share similar handling approaches:

Standard DOM Events:

click
dblclick
change
submit
keyup
keydown
focus
blur
These events can generally be handled with straightforward event listeners using addEventListener.

HTMX Special Events:

load
revealed
intersect
These events typically require specific conditions or states to trigger, such as page load or element visibility changes. They might involve additional checks or conditions beyond standard event listeners.

Modifiers:

delay:<time>
throttle:<time>
changed
Modifiers alter the timing or behavior of events. These might involve setting timeouts, debouncing, or checking for specific changes before triggering the event action.

Polling:

every <time>
Polling involves periodic checks or updates, requiring setInterval or setTimeout functionality to repeatedly trigger events at specified intervals.

Event Filters:

[<condition>]
Event filters trigger events based on specific conditions or criteria, such as key combinations or attribute values.

Custom Events:

Any custom event name you define
Custom events are user-defined and require listening for those specific events using addEventListener.

Multiple Triggers:

Comma-separated list of events (e.g., click, keyup)
Multiple triggers involve handling multiple event types simultaneously, potentially requiring iterating over the list and attaching event listeners accordingly.

From Modifier:

from:<CSS selector>
The from modifier listens for events originating from specified elements, requiring event delegation or checking event targets.

Target Modifier:

target:<CSS selector>
The target modifier specifies a different target for the triggered event, requiring targeting specific elements based on selectors.

Once Modifier:

once
The once modifier triggers the event only once, typically requiring adding an event listener with the { once: true } option.

Grouping Strategy:
Direct Event Listeners: Group standard DOM events that directly attach event listeners using addEventListener.

Conditional or Modified Event Handling: Group modifiers, event filters, custom events, and specialized HTMX events that require additional conditions, timeouts, or checks.

Configuration or Selector-Based Handling: Group modifiers like from and target that involve specific element targeting or delegation.

Next Steps:
Given these groupings, we can proceed to implement each group step-by-step, ensuring that we handle each type of trigger appropriately within our JavaScript code. Let me know how you'd like to proceed or if there's a specific trigger type you'd like to start with!
